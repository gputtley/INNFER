title: "Step: ResampleValidationForData"
---

This method is used for debugging purposes. It is to ensure that the processing of real data through the framework works, without running fits on the actual data. From the simulation, it resamples a possible data sample and this can then be used as the mock data. Note, this is not to be mistaken with the Asimov dataset, this is purely for debugging.
