INNFER (Invertible Neural Networks for Extracting Results) is a framework for performing simulation-based inference in a frequentist statistical setting. It enables multidimensional, unbinned likelihood fits by leveraging machine learning techniques to model probability densities. This approach provides an optimal and statistically rigorous way to perform high-dimensional data analyses while maintaining the interpretability of classical frequentist methods.


## Documentation

All documentation, including setup instructions, example commands, and the statistical methods available is available at [https://gputtley.github.io/INNFER/](https://gputtley.github.io/INNFER/).


## Help and Credits

The framework is developed at Imperial College London for initial use performing statistical analysis on data collected by the CMS experiment. If you have any questions about the repository contact George Uttley at george.peter.uttley@cern.ch.
